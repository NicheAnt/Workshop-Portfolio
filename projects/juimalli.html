The village of Juimalli – near Landsdowne Uttarakhand , is a small village. Farming was becoming increasingly hard.
Himjagriti – a NGO, had with the village elders , marked out a piece of land to make a Vocational training institute for the women of the village. To teach them sowing , weaving etc. We were asked to design six large ‘Halls’ that could function as multi-use spaces. Along with this a Toilet and bath unit to help with the sanitary situation in the village.
Owing to the steep slope at site , we had to retain the entire top side of the site with a traditional pusta (retaining wall) – well before we even got to the drawing board. This actually helped us come up with a split level concept- where one would either step up or down to the two halls in each block- and we connected these blocks using bridges.The roof was also developed from a standard single ridge sloping roof to a roof where the ridge and eaves were also sloped - to give it a more dynamic appearance. The residual spaces created by the stilts below the blocks was to be used as community space.The work went on hold in March of 2016 – after the first foundation was laid –owing to lack of funds.
