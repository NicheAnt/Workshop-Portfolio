      <p>A Driver/partner reporting Office for UBER located on the outskirts of Chandigarh. Done in association with Nice Frame Pvt. Ltd.
        </br></br>The design problem was to deal with a difference that existed in the types of users – a walk-in partner/driver and the 9-5 Uber employee.
        </br></br>The design approach was to create a strict division in the spaces. Two user types were separated from the reception on either sides, as the driver/partner office area and back office staff.
        </br></br>With the driver/partner user group, the waiting areas were centralized on the side of the main reception and waiting lobby.  The specialized spaces for partner interaction & reporting were placed around it.
        </br></br>Several graphics were designed to provide the sense of belonging to the users. One was an illustration of the cab made with driver names and second an interactive road map illustrated vinyl and glass, depicting the cab frequency on the streets of Chandigarh. The third graphic represented the landmarks of the city with company branding graphics as a background.
      </br></br>The back spaces were not made accessible to the drivers and were strictly were for employees to maintain the sense of privacy. They were also designed with a variation in theme, making it more inviting to the 9-5 user.
