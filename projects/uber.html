      <p>A Driver/partner Reporting Office  for UBER  located on the Outskirts of Chandigarh.
        </br></br>The design problem was to deal with a difference that existed in the types of users – one was a walk-in partner/driver and the other a 9-5 Uber employee.
        </br></br>The design approach was to create a strict division in the spaces. From the reception the two users were separated – One side would be the driver/partner office area and to the other is Back office staff.
        </br></br>With the driver/partner the waiting areas were centralized on the side of the main reception and waiting lobby, around which were organized the specialized spaces for partner interaction and reporting. Usage of graphics that were centered around the city of Chandigarh – like road maps , monuments as well as a name wall of the drivers and spaces for their mention in the news was also provided to give them a sense of belonging.
      </br></br>The back spaces are not accessible to the drivers and meant strictly for employees. They are designed with a variation in theme to make it more inviting to the 9-5 user. We have also worked on similar offices for uber in Lucknow (4000 sqft) and Hyderabad (8000 sqft).
