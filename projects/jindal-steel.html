      <p>The brief for this exhibition stall for Jindal Steel was to display the strength and lightness of steel. The enclosure was hence designed as an accessible sanctuary guarding two trees, exhibiting the material strength. This highlighted the values of the company as well as green characteristics of their product.
        </br></br>
       Fabricated in pipe steel as a ring, the enclosure was open to the corner rather than two sides of the corner stall. Designed with bracings, the ring was finished with pallet wood strips. The barks of the two trees were held together by stitch welding them onto four ring plates; and the branches, designed as half arches, spread outwards. The trees were designed with even numbered branches, to counterbalance the weight of the respective opposing branch.
