      <p>An exhibition stall for Jindal Steel,
        the brief was to showcase the strength and lightness of steel. The enclosure was designed to depict and accessible sanctuary guarding two trees- to highlight the values of the company as well as ‘green’ characteristics of their product- STEEL
        </br></br>The enclosure was designed in pipe steel as a ring which was open to the corner rather than two sides of the corner stall. Designed with bracings, the ring was finished with palette wood strips. For the two trees , the ‘ ‘barks’ were tied together by stitch welding them onto 4 ring plates from where the branches’ were designed as half arches that spread outwards. The tree’s were designed with a even numbered symmetry so that each branch acts as a counter weight for the opposing branch.</br></br>
